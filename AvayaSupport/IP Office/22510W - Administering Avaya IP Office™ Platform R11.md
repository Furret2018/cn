# Course Introduction
Welcome to the IP Office™ Administration course. The aim of this course is to offer the necessary information and tools to manage day to day moves and changes to your in-house system or systems.

The course will look at both IP Office™ 500 V2 and IP Office™ Server Edition.

All systems in the course are running on IP Office™ version 11 software. Please be aware that some of the configurations may be different if you have a lower version of software on your in-house system.

There will be information covered by the means of images and narration. Also, demonstrations will be given by video as how to perform certain tasks, please remember to click to play, where indicated.

We hope by the end of the course you feel confident to use the software management tool to create and edit Users, program features for them, and customise their profiles.

In addition, we will cover system features, to enable you to process an incoming call from start to finish, for daytime and night time scenarios.


# Course Overview
We will start this course by looking at the overview of IP Office™ hardware, and its major components.

Followed by the software interfaces which are required to manage your IP Office™ from day to day.

Using this software we will take you through selected system settings, including licensing, and system Short Codes. Moving then in to the creation and management of extensions and Users, this will include voicemail, button programming, User rights, self administration and using the Equinox® client. Which will then lead us into creating Hunt Groups and time profiles for the purpose of incoming calls and activating automatic night service for the system. We will also look at creating the system directory and the backing up the IP Office™ configuration, one x portal and Voicemail messages and greeting.

Finally, we will look at an overview of voicemail systems and compare the differences, and one-X Portal.
