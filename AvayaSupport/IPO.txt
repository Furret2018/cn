Line Short Codes
Short Codes can be programmed for lines
They only apply to incoming calls on that particular line.
These short codes are used to translate incoming digits received with calls. The stage at which they are applied varies between different line types and may be overridden by an extension number match.
Line Codes are not used with all types of trunk. On trunks where they are Used, they only work in particular operation modes. The stage at which they are applied also varies.
• IP Trunks
Line short codes are used if Small Community Networking (SCN) is not being used or no SCN user extension match occurs on the digits received. If no line short code match occurs then normal incoming call routing is applied.
• BRI and E1 Trunks
These types of trunks use line short codes immediately. If no short code match occurs then normal incoming call routing is applied.
• QSIG and S0 Trunks
S0 (BRI) trunks, and E1 and T1 trunks set to QSIG mode, use line short codes if the digits received do not match an internal extension number. These types of trunk do not use incoming call routing.






Short Code Examples
Dialing 9 for an outside line
By default the IP Office allows you to dial any number to the outside world. This will, however cause trouble when the first few digits you dial are someone's extension!
If you want your users to dial 9 to get outside trunk line, then the short code above will have to be in the system short code menu. This is one of the exception when you do not use * or # in the code.
When anyone dials a 9 plus a phone number, the IP Office sees the 9. Then saves the numbers following it to the variable N,
The feature is dial, so the IP Office will select an outside line and dial the digits that N represents.
The line taken will be the first available one on Line Group ID zero.

As we know, you can have Night service activated automatically using time profiles, but if you want to be able to manually control night service, this is done with short codes.
You will have to create 2 short codes, one to set night service, and one to clear night service.
The codes you use are up to you as long as they don't conflict with other codes
Here we see *88 to set night service and *89 to clear it.
It is important to then enter the group you want to put in to night service.
In this example the group Main is being used. Please note that the word Main has "speech marks" also called "quotation marks".
This is necessary for the short code to work.
Once the codes are created you can either dial them from a phone or assign them to a button on a specific user's telephone.

Short Code for Call Pick Up for Analog phones
This is a short code for call pickup in group Main.
If you have a lot of analog or dect phones, then theses type of codes are very useful, as those phone types have no buttons.

Withhold your number when out dialling
It is useful to know that there are special characters that can be used in the Telephone number field, such as W, which will tell the system to dial out but withhold the number you are dialling from. For other special characters please use the help pages for an explanation.

## Extension

Lesson Objectives
After completing this Learning Object you will be able to:
Define the various types of extensions the IP Office supports.

Extensions (Manager)
It is important to understand that the IP Office Server Edition does not support digital and analog phones, or trunks. Only IP and SIP connections are supported on the server based IP Office. The hardware based IP500v2 is needed to work as a gateway for these extensions.
This is also true for ISDN or analog lines. It is important to understand how the IP Office treats these extensions and how to view and add new ones.
Digital and analog extensions are created automatically by the IP Office 500v2.

If you add a new analog or digital phone expansion module, the system will find them and create extensions for the new ports that it sees.
Extension Id is a physical ID of the extension port generated by the system, only for its internal use.
For analog and digital extensions it is not configurable; with SIP or H323 VoIP extensions, this setting can be changed.
The Base ID is the configurable directory number of the extension's associated user, it is the extension number that you dial to reach the extension.
In Manager, there is a telephone icon associated with the phone extensions for Digital or Analog phones, and for VoIP phones, the icon is a red LAN cord connector. Again, when you create an extension in the Server Edition's Web manager you will only be offered to create either an H323 or SIP extension.
You can display and sort extensions by type in the Group Pane.
You can click on any of the column headers, and it will sort by that column.

Extensions (Web Management)
Here we see the same Extension screen in Web Management, it is the same as in Manager, just laid out differently. The beauty of web management is that it has the benefit of seeing all extensions across the networked "Solution".
It also has a Panel on the left, that allows you to select by type to make new and search easier.



Creating IP Extensions
H.323, IP DECT or SIP extensions can be added by right clicking on the Extension item in the Menu Tree on the left.
Alternatively, you may click on the little folder icon in the upper right corner as shown in this screenshot. However as you will see shortly when you create a user, you will be offered to create an extension for the user, so it is not necessary to create all your extension in the way.


IP Extensions (Web Management)
To add an extension in Web management click the Add Extension button, then select the extension type and the system the new extension is to be created on.
As you see, the actions are similar for both Web Management and Manager.
This principle is the same throughout the programming, unless stated otherwise.


Adding an IP or SIP Extension
Apply a base Extension number which is consistent with your extension range. Web management will require you to give the extension a password to register to the IP Office. This enables you to log into the extension with a phone.
We are only creating an extension here not a User, as you can have many more users than extensions if you want, of which any user can be logged on to this extension. We will be covering creating a User shortly.



Extension Settings
With Web Manager, existing extensions can be modified by clicking on the pencil icon, or in Manager by clicking on an individual entry.
The extension ID is used by the IP Office software. The base extension is what you dial to call the phone.
The different settings under each extension type for the “specific settings” are usually set to industry standards, and rarely need changing.
Calls are never routed directly to physical or logical extensions. Calls are always directed to a User within the IP Office system, because the user's phone may change. For any call to be presented to an endpoint, whether that be digital, IP, SIP or analogue, a user must be associated with the extension.


Learning Object Key Takeaways
Topics covered in this lesson include:
Define the various types of extensions the IP Office supports.





Lesson Objectives
After completing this Learning Object, you will be able to:
Understand how to configure and customize user settings to get the best out of the system for your users.




User Form
The User form can be found under Call management. This form is where most of the configuration of users is done.
We have broken it down into several different Learning objectives, accompanied by a demonstration.
To edit a users settings, use the pencil icon to edit, or use the trash bin on the right of the screen to delete the user.
To view certain users, you select them by “type” on the left pane, and search through users per Hunt Group per IP Office™ System, or by typing in their name in the search bar at the top of the screen. Please remember this function is only available in Web Manager.

To add a User, click on the Add User button in the top right of the screen. In an SCN network, you will be offered to choose which system you wish to add the user to.

On the next slide, you will see the same function on Manager.



Adding Users on Manager
In the thick client Manager Program, new users can be added by right clicking on the User item in the Menu tree on the left. Existing users can be customized by selecting the User entry found in the Group window, sorted by name or number.
Tabs for User configuration options run along the top of the user Details window.



User Settings
In Web Manager, Menu options are listed down the left side of the screen, click to select them if required.
When you create a new user or edit an existing one, the fields are the same whether you use Web Management or Manager, although their layouts look different. Now, we will look through some of the common fields and tabs used to customize each user.
Name – It’s the field that corresponds to the user’s mailbox name. Usually, it is the user’s “handle”, or nickname, or first initial and last name. It is case sensitive, supporting a maximum of 15 characters.
Do not use punctuation and characters such as #, ?, or /. Only alphanumeric characters and the space character are supported in this field. In an SCN, names must be unique. Names should not start with a space.
Full Name – It’s the field used by the dial by name directory, and the name that is displayed on phones that are called. The Full Name field will hold 30 characters maximum.
Password – It’s the Password that’s required for Avaya one-X® Portal or Avaya Equinox® client, when in use. Please note that it is NOT the voicemail password, which is found under the Voicemail field.
Extension – It’s the number you dial to call the user.
Profile -- Depending on what licenses you have in the IP Office™, here is where you assign productivity licenses (such as “Power User”) to specific users. Note that these profiles only appear here.
Login Code -- This code is used for Hotdesking, and login onto the phone, any password or login codes must be 6 digits or more in length and must not be consecutive number or match your extension number. You will get a warning if the password or login code rules are not met. Please note that the login code is found under the Telephony supervisor tab in Manager.

Note: It is possible to set up more users than available extensions. For example, you can set up logical users that can use the Hotdesking functionality that do not have a physical extension.
If at anytime, you need more information about a field, please see the help menu in the top right of the screen, it will take you to the help page of the screen you are viewing.


Additional User Features
Still on the same page but further down you will find additional user settings. Checkboxes control added functionality for the user. Note that some may be grayed out if a license is not available for that feature. The items in the upper red box are examples of this.

The User rights, Time profiles and Templates shown here are covered in a separate learning objects.

When you are done with your selections on this web page you may save the settings as a template and also update user.
If you are using Manager you will need to click OK, save your changes, and then Save “Configuration".
All changes in the user screen are mergeable.



User Telephony Tabs
In the Telephony menu, you will find 5 telephony sub tabs. Let's now take a look at some of the commonly used fields in these menus.

Here, we see highlighted the “No Answer Time”, we have also seen this in the System menu, which is where you set the default No Answer Time for all users. In this User/Telephony/ call Settings tab, you can set the No Answer Time to suit the individual user. This timer effects the time (in seconds) that a user's phone will ring before it goes to voicemail or is otherwise forwarded.

Under the Telephony Supervisor Settings tab you can set a logon idle time. It is used when a user is idle for too long then they will be logged off the phone.
The Monitor and coverage group settings allow you to chose the groups that the user can monitor, which means this user can listen in or possibly intrude on the selected group's calls. The Coverage Group selection assigns this user to a "ring group" chosen from a drop down menu. Like a Hunt Group with no features. These small groups have members whose phones all ring at the same time to cover a department like "Accounting" or perhaps a top manager's extension.
At the bottom of this screen, you can enable or disable certain features such as forwarding to external numbers, intrusion privacy, barring of outgoing calls, and other features.

The Telephony Multiline tab is for configuring coverage ring types and timers as needed, but one of the most important settings is also found here: Reserve Last CA.
This Reserve the Last Call appearance button on the user's phone is for outgoing calls only, ensuring that the user will always be able to call out at any time, no matter how many live calls they are handling. This feature is always set to NO in default, but it is a good idea to change it, so as not to cause a call blockage situation on a user's telephone.
Please remember, if they can not make a call on at least one of their appearance keys, then they will also not be able to transfer or even forward any calls either, if all the line buttons are in use.

The Telephony TUI tab has ten user features that are normally set with the system defaults. The user setting in the first box here normally says "Default", and the selections are all greyed out.
If you select Custom, as is shown here, then they all become active for you to change any or all of them. In this screen, Self Administration has been changed. Notice that you can save this as a Template.




User Forwarding Tabs
In the forwarding screen, the Call forwarding features can be set for the user.
The features that are enabled for the user often have a Short Code assigned to a phone button for the person to use.




User Twinning Tabs
Having their phone twinned with another number allows a user to make another number ring at the same time the user’s Deskphone rings. Either phone can answer the call.
This is frequently used for users with DECT wireless phones or mobile phones.
This is very useful for anyone who has to work away from their desk.
When the twinned number is offsite and the IP Office™ needs to make an outside call, there is, sometimes, a slight delay to ring the twinned phone.



User Hunt Group and DND Tabs
Group Membership shows the groups the user belongs to. The list of the user's groups is displayed, and a checkmark for a listed group means the user is enabled and active in the group. If not, then the user is out of the group.
In the do not disturb tab, you can manually put the user In and Out of the “Do Not Disturb” condition, but the user can also do this from their phone.
In the exception list here, you can enter special phone numbers which can dial the user even when they are in “Do Not Disturb”. This can be an internal or external number.



User Recording Tabs
Recording of user's calls can be initiated from a user's telephone via a Short Code or an assigned button. The recording will go to the user's voice mailbox. Recording can also be done automatically via the settings on this screen, over which the user has no control. These automatic recordings can be sent to a specific mailbox. This is not recommended for automatic recording of all calls, as you can soon fill up the target mailbox with recordings. To trim down this volume of data, you can set a percentage of calls to be recorded, if you just want samples of the calls.
Avaya Call Recorder is an optional call recording application that automatically captures, indexes, and archives recorded calls to its own hard drive or partition. It has many useful recording choices, it has a broad set of search filters, and it can verify that the recording has not been altered.
Which ever way you'd like to record a call, a voicemail port is used for it, so please make sure you have enough voicemail ports to accommodate the amount of simultaneous recordings.



User Personal Directory Tabs
Each user has their own personal directory, which can be entered on their phone, or in this menu. This directory will only display on this User’s extension. It is also possible to import and export numbers in this directory.
If the ICLID (Incoming Caller’s Line Identity) is present on the incoming lines, then any incoming numbers matching a directory entry will display the name associated with that number.

## Using With Voicemail


Lesson Objective
After completing this Learning Object, you will be able to:
Understand how Voicemail works with Users and Hunt Groups.

Users Voicemail
Whenever you create a User or a Hunt Group, a mailbox is automatically created too. By default, each user's extension number is set as a trusted number, as we will see on the next slide.
Also by default, a mailbox is not given a voicemail code, which will not be a problem if your users are only going to access their mailboxes from their extensions. They can do this from their Deskphones by either pressing the message button on their phones or by dialing the default Short Code *17.
However, If you wish to let the users call in from different numbers, then you must enter a voicemail code for each user in this form. Users will have to enter this code to access the voice mailbox.
The code must be a minimum of four digits in length, they must NOT be consecutive numbers, and must NOT match the extension number.
The voicemail settings are found in the user menu under the voicemail tab seen here in the upper left.
You can also set up voicemail to email here, and an UMS - Unified Messaging Service - if the user has a required Profile license.
Another mailbox feature which can be set up in this screen, is the ability for callers to breakout of the user's greeting to an alternative destination. The user's recorded greeting must instruct the caller that they can press 0, 2 or 3 (for example) to be routed to another number.
The internal or external target number can be entered into the breakout DTMF fields, present at the bottom of this screen.



Voicemail Trusted Sources
You can enter more than one trusted source for mailbox access.
By default, only the user's extension number is entered in to the source number field. Shown here, the entry is V200 for extension 200. It enables this user to dial in to their mailbox from their extension, listen to messages, and change their greeting without entering a passcode. Calls from other extensions or from outside can leave messages, but those calls cannot get messages or change greetings without a login code.
It is possible to enter more numbers in this field by clicking "add" at the top right of the screen.
These can be internal or external numbers, so if desired, you could put a user's mobile number in here, and that user would be able to dial into their mailbox from their mobile phone without entering a passcode. However, you must put a capital “V” in front of the number to indicate it is a trusted source.


Hunt Group Mailbox
Hunt Group mailboxes have similar setting to Users.
As mentioned before, when you create a Hunt Group, a mailbox is also created. It can be turned On and Off, and it also requires a voicemail code in the same way as a User mailbox.
Hunt Group voicemail is different; in it you can set a timer as to when the call goes to voicemail, such as after a call has rung in the group for 45 seconds and there is no answer.
If an overflow group is created for the Hunt Group, please be careful setting the timers. If the overflow timer is longer than the voicemail timer, the call will always go to voicemail before the overflow group gets a chance to answer.
If the call does go to an overflow group and then to voicemail, the message will be left in the mailbox of the group which was first called to save confusion.



Message Indication
When a message is left in a User's mailbox, the Message Waiting Indicator light will be illuminated on the phone. However, if a message is left in a Hunt Group's mailbox, no message waiting indication will be made unless you program one or more users to be notified.
To do this you must enter the Hunt Group number or name with a capital ‘H’ in front of it in the user source Number field, as we see here.
The only way the user will know if the message is for their personal mailbox or for the Group mailbox, is by pressing the message button on their handset.
They will then be able to see in the screen which mailboxes have message in them.
Only users with the Hunt Group name or number in their source number field will be offered this information.
Multiple users can be responsible for a single mailbox. This is true for both Hunt Groups and for Single Users.
When one of these users has listened to all new messages, then the light will go out on all of their phones. This prevents the duplication of messages taken by users.
