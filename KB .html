On another case: when Partner installs CM-Duplex-07.1.0.0.532-kvm-001, Partner assigns too much resource (8 CPU and 16GB Memory) to the KVM, 
then also meet the same issue "after duplex version installation, it becomes Simplex version". (see ticket 1-16893210042)

 You can also refer to the KB :

How to configure the duplex link on KVM

Seen from above cases, too much or less resource will cause the problem. so please follow the CM installation documentation and provide the proper source for CM installation.
